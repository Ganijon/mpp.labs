Project Management Tracking System

We have multiple projects to manage. 

Each project has a product backlog which has all the features that could be included in this project.  

A project has multiple releases.  

The product backlog features are added to a particular release by our project manager.  

Each release is made up of one or more sprints. Sprints contain a subset of the release features and have a due date. (Read about sprints here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(software_development)  

Each feature in a sprint is assigned to a developer.  

Each developer will estimate the effort required to complete their feature.  

Each day the developer provides an estimate of the remaining work needed to complete their feature.  

Each day the project manager reports on the amount of work completed for the sprint and the amount of work remaining for the sprint.
